# yams
YAMS, short for "Yet Another Macintosh Simulator", is an emulator for 68k macs, and is not ready for use. Development is active, so keep checking back!

YAMS requires a ROM from the system being emulated to be present in order to function. Currently, the only target machine is MacSE.
Until YAMS develops a proper configuration file, it expects this ROM to be named "MacSE.ROM", and be present in the 
working directory.
